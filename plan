rooms are created in populate.py for now, as are the decks for each room.

HAND/ROOM/BROWSER:
    get room browser working
    get user hand model / reset working
    when player clicks join, their state is changed and they are redirected
    user is added to chosen room's model in db
    js pulls current_user's cash and all of that room's users
    with the room users pulled, display everyone's hands
    if player leaves room, remove their connection to the room model

STATES:
    0 = state for not in a game?
    1 = joined, not in bet or hit phase
    2 = bet phase
    3 = hit phase
    4 = split phase?
    loop in js that continuously pulls current_user's state
    add state-switching to user actions and hide some things based on state, i.e. only 1 and 2 can leave table
